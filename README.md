# Descent-for-high-degree-ideals-in-NFS-DL


This is an implementation detail in our algorithm to find the virtual logarithm of a degree two prime ideals with the virtual logarithms of degree one prime ideals that are already known in the factor base. The main technique is presented in the paper and there left the problem of compute Schirokauer maps. We are adding these details here and will present a full descent procedure without the square free restriction. We use cado-nfs for finding relations and Magma to compute the Schirokauer maps and verify.
